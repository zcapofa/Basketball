# NBA Play-by-Play Data Retrieval and Prediction with Prefect, Docker, and ML
This project demonstrates how to use Prefect, Docker, and machine learning (ML) to retrieve NBA play-by-play data from the NBA API, and potentially predict future matchups based on historical data.

Project Structure
Dockerfile: Defines the Docker image for the project.
execute_flow.py: Prefect flow script that orchestrates the retrieval of NBA play-by-play data.
requirements.txt: Contains the Python dependencies required for the project.
your_script.py: Contains the NBA play-by-play data retrieval logic.
README.md: This file.
Retrieval Logic
The NBA play-by-play data retrieval logic is implemented in your_script.py. This script interacts with the NBA API to fetch play-by-play data for each game ID. The retrieved data includes details such as period, clock time, description of the play, and scores for both home and away teams. This data is then processed and formatted as needed.

Potential ML Predictions
In addition to retrieving play-by-play data, this project explores the possibility of using machine learning (ML) to predict potential future matchups based on historical data. By analyzing past games, player statistics, team performance, and other relevant factors, ML models can be trained to predict the outcome of future games or identify patterns in play-by-play data that could indicate potential game strategies or player behavior.
